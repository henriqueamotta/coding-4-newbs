A web platform designed to help beginner programmers.

## üìñ Overview
The project serves as a collaborative knowledge base where users can find and discuss technical terms, read detailed articles, and even ask questions to an artificial intelligence named "Latinha"

## ‚ú® Detailed Features
Code analysis reveals a robust application with automated features and strong access control.

### üß† AI Content Generation
The platform's core leverages the OpenAI API (GPT-4o) to automate content creation, ensuring quality and consistency.

* **Automatic Generation of Articles and Terms:** When a new **Term** or **Article** is created (or its name is updated), the content (`description` or `content`) is automatically generated by the AI based on a prompt specialized for technical writing.
* **Asynchronous Q&A with Chatbot:** The **Q&A** section operates asynchronously. When a user submits a question, the AI's response is processed in the background by a **background job** (`Solid Queue`), improving user experience by not blocking the interface.

### üí¨ Forums and Community
The platform encourages community interaction through a structured forum system.

* **Contextual Forums:** Each **Article** can have multiple discussion **Forums**, allowing conversations to be focused and organized by topic.
* **Data Integrity:** The data structure ensures that when an **Article** is removed, all its associated **Forums** and **Messages** are also removed (`dependent: :destroy`), maintaining database consistency.

### üîê Access Control and Permissions
The application uses **Devise** for authentication and **Pundit** for granular authorization control.

* **Public vs. Restricted Access:** Viewing lists and details of **Articles** and **Terms** is public. However, create, edit, or delete actions require user authentication.
* **Role-Based Authorization:** Pundit policies ensure that only authorized users (likely administrators) can manage core content (Articles and Terms), while logged-in users can create Forums and Messages.

### üíª User Experience (UX)
Several features have been implemented to create a fluid and modern user experience.

* **Markdown Content:** Texts for Articles, Terms, and Forums are written in Markdown and rendered as HTML (`Redcarpet`), allowing for rich content formatting.
* **Real-Time Updates:** On the Q&A page, new questions and answers appear on the screen instantly without a full page reload, thanks to the use of **Turbo Streams**.
* **Featured Content:** The main articles page automatically highlights the most recent article, keeping the homepage fresh.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This application was built with a modern set of technologies from the Ruby on Rails ecosystem:

* **Backend:** Ruby `3.3.5`, Rails `7.2.2`
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Frontend:** Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus), Importmap
* **CSS Framework:** Bootstrap `5.2`, SASS, Font Awesome
* **Authentication:** Devise
* **Authorization:** Pundit
* **Background Jobs:** Solid Queue
* **WebSockets:** Solid Cable
* **File Uploads:** Cloudinary and Active Storage
* **AI Interaction:** `ruby-openai`
* **Markdown Rendering:** Redcarpet

## ‚òùÔ∏è Getting Started
To run the project in your local development environment, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

* Ruby `3.3.5`
* Bundler
* PostgreSQL
* Node.js (required for the Rails asset pipeline)

### üìÅ Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [PLACEHOLDER: YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd coding4newbs
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bundle install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    ```sh
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
    # rails db:seed
    ```
    *(Note: Uncomment `rails db:seed` if your project has a `seeds.rb` file to populate the initial database).*

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can use the example below as a template.
    ```sh
    # .env

    OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_openai_api_key"
    CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name"
    ```

### üìÇ Usage
To start the local server, run the following command:

```sh
rails server
```

You can now access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### ‚úÖ Runing Tests
To run the automated test suite, use the following command:

```sh
bin/rails test
```
